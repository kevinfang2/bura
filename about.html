                Facing volatile currencies and geopolitical risk, Africans stand
                to greatly benefit from crypto and defi. However, due to a lack
                of digital devices and ICT training, generations of Africans in
                peri-rural and rural areas are unable to access such
                technologies.

                Play-to-earn games represent an opportunity to educate and
                onboard populations into the crypto ecosystem, but have yet to
                be prevalent in Western Africa due to low rates of ownership of
                digital devices.
